This is a strategy game where the goal is to build a train empire that spans as much of the United States as possible. 

The core gameplay surrounds building out stations, then connecting them together. Then passengers will begin to ride your trains and pay you money. Stations can only connect to cities close-by, so to build an empire, you will need to link many stations together.

Here are the different commands that can be executed within the game.

Build Stations - get started by building two stations in different cities. Just say something like "Build a station in New York."

Connect Stations - once you have stations built, connect them by stating the two city names. For example, say something like "Connect New York to Boston".

Run Empire - Once you have connected trains, passengers will start to ride.  Saying "Run Empire" will operate the trains for a month, gaining you more money to build additional stations.

If you need help, just say "Help", or here are some other phrases that can assist you in finding different options.

How much money do I have? - gives the current balance sheet of cash in your empire that can be spent on building new trains or stations.
List Cities to build Stations - this lists the different cities that the game allows stations to be built in.
Which Stations are Connected - this lists what cities you have already built stations in, and what they connect to.
How much is track from Houston to Dallas - provides the distance between different cities, as well as how much track costs between them.
